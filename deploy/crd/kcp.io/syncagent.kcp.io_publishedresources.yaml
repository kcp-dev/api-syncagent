            PublishedResource describes how an API type (usually defined by a CRD)
            on the service cluster should be exposed in kcp workspaces. Besides
            controlling how namespaced and cluster-wide resources should be mapped,
            the GVK can also be transformed to provide a uniform, implementation-independent
            access to the APIs inside kcp.

                APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
                Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
                may reject unrecognized values.

                    Naming can be used to control how the namespace and names for local objects
                    are formed. If not specified, the Sync Agent will use defensive defaults to
                    prevent naming collisions in the service cluster.
                    When configuring this, great care must be taken to not allow for naming
                    collisions to happen; keep in mind that the same name/namespace can exists in
                    many different kcp workspaces.
