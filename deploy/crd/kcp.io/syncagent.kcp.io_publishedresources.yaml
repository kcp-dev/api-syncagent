            PublishedResource describes how an API type (usually defined by a CRD)
            on the service cluster should be exposed in kcp workspaces. Besides
            controlling how namespaced and cluster-wide resources should be mapped,
            the GVK can also be transformed to provide a uniform, implementation-independent
            access to the APIs inside kcp.

                APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
                Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and

                    should only be used if the workspace path is of interest on the

                    Projection is used to change the GVK of a published resource within kcp.
                    This can be used to hide implementation details and provide a customized API
                    experience to the user.
                    All fields in the projection are optional. If a field is set, it will overwrite
                    that field in the GVK. The namespaced field can be set to turn a cluster-wide
                    resource namespaced or vice-versa.

                        the singular name by lowercasing the resource kind. In addition, if this is set,
                        the plural name will also be updated by taking the lowercased kind name and appending
                        an "s". If this would yield an undesirable name, use the plural field to explicitly
                        give the plural name.
