If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.</p> string object <p>matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is \u201ckey\u201d, the operator is \u201cIn\u201d, and the values array contains only \u201cvalue\u201d. The requirements are ANDed.</p> object Required object <p>Regex is a Go regular expression that is optionally applied to the selected value from the path.</p> string <p>Pattern can be left empty to simply replace the entire value with the replacement.</p> string <p>Replacement is the string that the matched pattern is replaced with. It can contain references to groups in the pattern by using \\N.</p> object <p>TemplateExpression is a Go templated string that can make use of variables to construct the resulting string.</p> string object <p>Template is a Go templated string that can make use of variables to construct the resulting string.</p> string string Required object Required <p>Describes the \u201csource\u201d Resource that exists on this, the service cluster, that should be exposed in kcp workspaces. All fields have to be specified.</p> string Required <p>The API group of a resource, for example \u201cstorage.initroid.com\u201d.</p> string Required <p>The resource Kind, for example \u201cDatabase\u201d.</p> string <p>The API version, for example \u201cv1beta1\u201d. Setting this field will only publish the given version, otherwise all versions for the group/kind will be published.</p> <p>Deprecated: Use .versions instead.</p> array <p>Versions allows to select a subset of versions to publish.
